# Control Sheet

My intention with this project is to create a streamlined system for non-developer website managers to edit their content, and have those changes appear on their website in real time.

#TODO:

-hook the tables up to change the JSON

-publish the JSON at a URL

-make logins/security

-make buttons to add more rows/columns/tables

-add booleans, images, short and long text, etc.
